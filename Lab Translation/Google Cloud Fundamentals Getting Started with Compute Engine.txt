
# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

   - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

   - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

   - Connect between the two instances.



#Task 1: Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

## Steps:

      * gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --image=debian-9-stretch-v20190123" 
          --subnet=default  --tags http

      * gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW  --direction=INGRESS  --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http



#Task 2: Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface:

## Steps:

       a. To display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you run this command:
  
             * gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

       b. Run the command to create my-vm-2 virtual machine instance:

            * gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190123"\
              --subnet "default" 



#Task 3:  Connect between the two instances:

## Steps:

        a.Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
        
         i.   connect to my-vm-2 by running the command:

              * gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2


        ii.  ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2 by running the command:

              * ping -c 3 my-vm-1 


        iii. Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2 by running the command:

              * ssh my-vm-1

      
         iv.  At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server by running the command:
            
              * sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y


         v.  Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server: 

              * sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html


        vi.  Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
            
              * HI from OMOYIBO JONES


        vii. Exit the editor and Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

              * curl http://localhost/

              - Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including the line of custom text.

         
       viii. To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
         
              *  exit


         ix. To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
           
              * curl http://my-vm-1/

              - Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including the line of custom text.

         x. Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1  by running this command:

                 gcloud compute instances list --zone us-central1-a
        
         xi. Paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab:
              
               -Result: The  web server's home page will be displayed, including the custom text
