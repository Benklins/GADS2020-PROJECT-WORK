# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine


## Objectives:
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

 - Initialize App Engine.

 - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

 - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

 - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.



##Task 1: Initialize App Engine:

# Steps: 

       a. Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region by running the command:
       
            * gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --region=us-central

       b. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory by executing the command:
 
            * git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

       c.  Change the working directory  to the source directory by running: 

            * cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

   
##Task 2: Run Hello World application locally:

# Steps: 

       a.  To download and update the packages list execute the command below:
        
            * sudo apt-get update

       b.  Set up a virtual environment in which to the application; If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter by running the command:

            * sudo apt-get install virtualenv

       c.  Activate the virtual environment:
 
            * source venv/bin/activate

       d.  Navigate to  project directory and install dependencies:

            *  pip install  -r requirements.txt

       e. Run the application by executing the command:

            *  python main.py 

      f.  To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.

      g.  To verify that the app is not deployed yet run the command.
 
            * gcloud app instances list
           
            - result: Notice that no resources are deployed.

     
##Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

# Steps:   

         a.  Navigate to the source directory by running the command: 
 
              * cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

         b. To deploy the application,run the command below. If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter. :
  
              * gcloud app deploy

        c.  Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
 
              * gcloud app browse

        d. Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window gotten from running the "gcloud app browse"

             - Result: Hello World!

        

##Task 4: Disable the application

# Steps:   

          a. run the command below to disable the application:
          
              * gcloud app versions stop 20200910t170151 
       
         b.  refresh the browser window  to view to the application site, 404 error will be displayed.
