
#  Getting Started with VPC Networking


## Objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

   - Explore the default VPC network

   - Create an auto mode network with firewall rules

   - Create VM instances using Compute Engine

   - Explore the connectivity for VM instances

#Task 1: Explore the default network

## Steps:

      i.  View the subnets by running the command:

          * gcloud compute networks subnets list


      ii.  View the default routes by running the command:
    
         * gcloud compute routes list --filter="network=default"
 
    
      iii.  View the firewall rules by running the command:
  
         * gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter network=default


      iv. Delete the default network Firewall rules by running the commands:

         gcloud compute firewall-rules delete default-allow-icmp 
         gcloud compute firewall-rules delete default-allow-rdp
         gcloud compute firewall-rules delete default-allow-ssh 
         gcloud compute firewall-rules delete default-allow-internal

       v.  Delete the default network by running the command:

          * gcloud compute networks delete default
    
       - Confirm the deletion of the default network by running the commands:

          * gcloud compute routes list --filter="network=default"

          * gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter network=default

      vi. Verify that you cannot create a VM instance without a VPC network by running the command:

          * gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190123" --subnet          "default" 

          -result: Cannot create a VM instance without a VPC network!


#Task 2: Create a VPC network and VM instances

##steps:

   a.  Create an auto mode VPC network with Firewall rules

         * gcloud compute firewall-rules create mynetwork-allow-internal --project=qwiklabs-gcp-02-30a358d2da25 --network=mynetwork --description=Allows\                  connections from any source in the  network IP range to  any instance on the network using all protocols. --direction=INGRESS --priority=65534 \
            --source-ranges=10.128.0.0/9 --action=ALLOW --rules=all  

         * gcloud compute firewall-rules create mynetwork-allow-rdp  --network=mynetwork --description=Allows RDP connections from any source to any\                       instance on the network using port 3389. --direction=INGRESS --priority=65534 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:3389\
             

         * gcloud compute firewall-rules create mynetwork-allow-ssh  --network=mynetwork --description=Allows TCP connections from any source to any\                      instance on the network using port 22. --direction=INGRESS --priority=65534 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:22 \
          

      

     iii. Record the IP address range for the subnets in us-central1 and europe-west1 by running the command:

        * gcloud compute networks subnets list --network=mynetwork


   b.   Create a VM instance in us-central1 by running the command:

        * gcloud compute  instances create mynet-us-vm --zone=us-central1-c --machine-type=f1-micro --subnet=mynetwork  



   c.    Create a VM instance in europe-west1 by running the command:
       
         * gcloud  compute instances create mynet-eu-vm --zone=europe-west1-c --machine-type=f1-micro --subnet=mynetwork


#Task 3: Explore the connectivity for VM instances

          *  gcloud compute firewall-rules delete mynetwork-allow-internal
 

      ii. To test connectivity to mynet-eu-vm's internal IP, run the following command

          * ping -c 3  10.132.0.2 
            
          - result: 100% packet lost.


     iii. Close the SSH terminal:
            
             * exit


    d. Remove the allow-ssh firewall rules

        i. Remove the  allow-ssh firewall  rule by running the command:

       ii.  For mynet-us-vm, run the following command to confirm if connection can be established successfuly:

              * gcloud compute ssh mynet-us-vm
